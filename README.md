# SmartPass
A python password generator that creates passwords of various lengths and difficulties. Includes a GUI.

My project idea is a password manager. It would be used by people who have lots of internet accounts and don’t want to use the same password for every account, but also need help creating them. During this time where it’s extremely important to be secure online and needing more specific passwords to meet the tougher requirements, a password generator is a great tool! It generates passwords based on provided guidelines and creates a strong, unpredictable password for your accounts. These passwords provide greater security. These passwords need to meet the requirements of generating completely random passwords of any length, including numbers, letters and symbols. The user can select the password length and click on the generate password button. You are able to copy the password automatically by clicking ‘copy to clipboard’. In order to build this, I would be using Tkinter. I think that I can work on this project solo.
